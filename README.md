matplotlib is use with python to represent in data vistualization. #why we use- #--- if large data is tabular format or any other format then find , check the data are complicated to decision making process Plotting of data can be extensively made possible in an interactive way by Matplotlib, which is a plotting library that can be demonstrated in Python scripts. Plotting of graphs is a part of data vistualization, and this property can be achieved by making use of Matplotlib. Matplotlib makes use of many general-purpose GUI toolkits, such as wxPython, Tkinter, QT, etc., in order to provide object-oriented APIs for embedding plots into applications.
